**Context plane · Active** — under development; the surface still moves.
See the [component map](https://github.com/Barnett-Studios) for how this fits the rest.

**Spends CPU cycles so you don't spend tokens.**

cxpak indexes your codebase using tree-sitter across 43 languages, builds a typed dependency graph, and produces token-budgeted context bundles that give LLMs a briefing packet instead of a flashlight in a dark room. It understands your code's architecture, conventions, risk profile, and data layer -- then packs exactly what the LLM needs, nothing more.

## What it looks like

`cxpak visual` renders a self-contained single-page dashboard -- three modes, inlined D3, **zero external assets, works offline**. Nineteen built-in colour palettes and a Cmd+K command palette over every file, symbol, and view. Every number on the page traces to a real computation; click any risk to see its exact derivation.

## Install

```bash
brew tap Barnett-Studios/tap && brew install cxpak   # macOS/Linux
cargo install cxpak                                   # any platform, incl. Windows
```

On Windows, `cargo install cxpak` works, or download the prebuilt
`cxpak-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Barnett-Studios/cxpak/releases/latest).

## Docker

Docker is a first-class deployment option — useful anywhere you want a reproducible, isolated install without managing a Rust toolchain: CI pipelines, sandboxed servers, Windows machines, or air-gapped environments.

### Official image (recommended)

Multi-arch (`amd64` / `arm64`) images are published to GitHub Container Registry on every release — no build, no Rust toolchain, no source checkout:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/repo" ghcr.io/barnett-studios/cxpak overview .
```

Pin a tag or an immutable digest for reproducible deploys:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/repo" ghcr.io/barnett-studios/cxpak:3.1.0 overview .
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/repo" ghcr.io/barnett-studios/cxpak@sha256:<digest> overview .
```

Images are signed with [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) (keyless) and carry SBOM + build-provenance attestations. Verify before deploying:

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/barnett-studios/cxpak:3.1.0 \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/Barnett-Studios/cxpak/' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

### From source

```bash
docker build -t cxpak .
```

Builds the full default feature set from your local checkout. First build is slow (candle ML deps); subsequent builds reuse a cached dependency layer.

### Self-hosted / air-gapped

[`Dockerfile.standalone`](Dockerfile.standalone) fetches the pre-built release binary, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, and packages it into an `ubuntu:24.04` runtime — no source checkout or Rust toolchain required. All base images and the downloaded binary are digest-pinned for reproducible builds.

All three build-args are **required** — the build fails immediately if any is omitted, so you can never accidentally produce a stale or mismatched image. Checksums are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/Barnett-Studios/cxpak/releases).

```bash
# SHA-256 values are per-release — copy the two for VERSION from the releases page.
docker build -f Dockerfile.standalone \
  --build-arg VERSION=3.1.0 \
  --build-arg SHA256_AMD64=<cxpak-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu checksum> \
  --build-arg SHA256_ARM64=<cxpak-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu checksum> \
  -t cxpak:3.1.0 .
```

### Usage

The container runs as a non-root user; the embedding model weights (~30 MB, downloaded on first use) live under `/home/cxpak/.cxpak` — mount a named volume there to persist them across runs.

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
# One-shot command
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/repo" ghcr.io/barnett-studios/cxpak overview .

# HTTP server (--bind 0.0.0.0 required to reach the container from the host;
# --token is mandatory when binding to a non-loopback address)
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v "$(pwd):/repo" \
  -v cxpak-models:/home/cxpak/.cxpak \
  ghcr.io/barnett-studios/cxpak serve --bind 0.0.0.0 --token mysecret .

# MCP — stdio only, one repo per instance (see note below)
docker run --rm -i -v "$(pwd):/repo" ghcr.io/barnett-studios/cxpak serve --mcp .
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# One-shot command
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/repo ghcr.io/barnett-studios/cxpak overview .

# HTTP server
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 `
  -v ${PWD}:/repo `
  -v cxpak-models:/home/cxpak/.cxpak `
  ghcr.io/barnett-studios/cxpak serve --bind 0.0.0.0 --token mysecret .

# Verify (use curl.exe — PowerShell's curl alias does not work here)
curl.exe http://localhost:3000/health

# MCP — stdio only, one repo per instance (see note below)
docker run --rm -i -v ${PWD}:/repo ghcr.io/barnett-studios/cxpak serve --mcp .
```

Replace `mysecret` with any non-empty secret of your choice. `/health` is open (GET) as a liveness probe; every other endpoint requires the bearer token when one is set (with no `--token`, on a loopback bind, all routes are open):
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health                                        # no auth required
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecret" http://localhost:3000/v1/conventions
```

> **HTTP vs MCP:** These are two separate transports — you cannot use the HTTP server as an MCP endpoint.
>
> **MCP scope:** Each MCP instance indexes exactly one repository — the path passed at startup (`.` in the examples above, which maps to the mounted `/repo`). To serve multiple repos simultaneously, run one container per repo and register each in your MCP client config. The HTTP server has the same single-repo scope.

## Quick start

```bash
# See your codebase the way an LLM should
cxpak overview .

# Trace a symbol through the dependency graph
cxpak trace "handle_request" .

# Generate an interactive dashboard
cxpak visual --visual-type dashboard .

# Get a guided reading order for onboarding
cxpak onboard .
```

## Use with AI tools

### Claude Code / Cursor (MCP)

Add to `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cxpak": {
      "command": "cxpak",
      "args": ["serve", "--mcp", "."]
    }
  }
}
```

Your AI tool gets five intent-parameterized tools; each selects a capability via a required `op` argument. `cxpak_context` (`op: "context"`) is the main entry point -- one call, optimal context:

| Intent tool | Capabilities (via `op`) |
|----------|-------|
| **`cxpak_context`** | `context`, `retrieval`, `search`, `overview`, `stats`, `briefing`, `pack_context`, `context_for_task` |
| **`cxpak_graph`** | `graph` (`nodes`/`node`/`neighbors`/`path`/`subgraph`), `trace`, `blast_radius`, `call_graph`, `dead_code`, `api_surface`, `data_flow`, `cross_lang`, `predict` |
| **`cxpak_data`** | `data` (indexed / live schema) |
| **`cxpak_review`** | `review`, `diff`, `verify` |
| **`cxpak_insight`** | `health`, `risks`, `architecture`, `conventions`, `security_surface`, `drift`, `visual`, `onboard` |

<!-- advertised-tool-names: exempt — this paragraph's subject IS the pre-3.0 names, so naming
     them is its job. The exemption is declared here rather than hardcoded in the test, so moving
     or deleting this paragraph removes the exemption with it. -->
The v2.x per-tool names (`cxpak_auto_context`, `cxpak_health`, ...) remain callable as deprecated aliases; **`tools/list` does not advertise them**, so a client that builds its callable set from the advertised surface will not find them. No removal release is set. See [`docs/MIGRATION-3.0.md`](docs/MIGRATION-3.0.md).

On large repositories, `cxpak serve --mcp` answers the MCP `initialize` handshake immediately and builds the index in the background -- fixing the startup timeout. Tool calls that arrive before the index is ready get a graceful retry status, then byte-identical results once it is built.

### Claude Code Plugin

```
/plugin install cxpak
```

Auto-triggers on architecture questions and change reviews. Slash commands: `/cxpak:overview`, `/cxpak:trace`, `/cxpak:diff`, `/cxpak:clean`.

### HTTP Server

```bash
cxpak serve .                          # port 3000
cxpak serve --token my-secret .        # with Bearer auth on /v1/ endpoints
cxpak watch .                          # file watcher with hot index
```

### LSP

```bash
cxpak lsp .                            # stdio, works with any LSP client
```

CodeLens, hover, diagnostics, workspace symbols, plus 16 custom `cxpak/*` methods. Supports `didOpen`/`didChange`/`didClose` for in-editor reactivity.

## Core capabilities

### Auto Context

`cxpak_context` (`op: "context"`) is the primary entry point. Give it a task and token budget; it returns exactly what the LLM needs.

The pipeline: query expansion with domain-specific synonyms, relevance scoring over **6 deterministic signals** (keyword, symbol, path, domain, import proximity, PageRank) fused with **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** -- the default ranking as of 3.0.0, measured +164% recall over the prior weighted-sum on a 31-PR benchmark and deterministic across processes -- then seed selection, noise filtering, test/schema/blast-radius enrichment, progressive degradation (Full > Trimmed > Documented > Signature > Stub), and per-file annotations explaining why each file was included. Embeddings are an optional 7th signal (see [Embeddings](#embeddings)).

Every response starts with a Repository DNA section -- a ~1000 token convention summary so the LLM knows how your team writes code before it sees any.

### Intelligence

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Health Score** | Composite metric across conventions, test coverage, churn stability, coupling, cycles, dead code |
| **Risk Ranking** | Files ranked by churn x blast radius x test gap -- the ones most likely to cause problems |
| **Architecture** | Per-module coupling, cohesion, circular dependencies, boundary violations, god files |
| **Blast Radius** | Change impact: direct dependents, transitive dependents, test files, schema dependents, each with risk scores |
| **Change Prediction** | Structural + historical (180-day co-change) + call-graph signals, confidence 0.3--0.9 |
| **Architecture Drift** | Compare against stored baselines; auto-saves snapshots for trend tracking |
| **Dead Code** | Symbols with zero callers, ranked by importance (PageRank x visibility) |
| **Call Graph** | Cross-file call edges with Exact/Approximate confidence levels |
| **Security Surface** | Unprotected endpoints, secrets, SQL injection, validation gaps, exposure scores across 12 frameworks |
| **Data Flow** | Trace values source-to-sink through the call graph; reports module/language/security boundary crossings |
| **Cross-Language** | HTTP, FFI, gRPC, GraphQL, shared schema, and exec bridges between languages |

### Visual Intelligence

Six interactive views, self-contained HTML with D3.js. No build step, no CDN.

```bash
cxpak visual --visual-type dashboard .
cxpak visual --visual-type architecture .
cxpak visual --visual-type risk .
cxpak visual --visual-type flow --symbol handle_request .
cxpak visual --visual-type timeline .
cxpak visual --visual-type diff --files "src/api.rs,src/db.rs" .
```

Export formats: HTML, Mermaid, SVG, PNG, C4 DSL, JSON.

Layout engine: Sugiyama method with SCC condensation, barycenter crossing minimization, Brandes-Kopf coordinate assignment, and 7+/-2 cognitive clustering.

### Conventions

Extracts a quantified convention profile from what your team actually does: naming, imports, error handling, dependencies, testing, visibility, function length, git health. Each pattern has counts, percentages, and strength labels (Convention >= 90%, Trend >= 70%, Mixed).

`cxpak_review` (`op: "verify"`) checks code changes against observed conventions -- only flags violations in changed lines. `cxpak conventions export/diff` enables CI drift detection with SHA256 checksums.

### Onboarding

```bash
cxpak onboard .
```

Generates a dependency-ordered reading guide: files topologically sorted, grouped into phases by module, ordered by PageRank. Each file lists key symbols to focus on and an estimated reading time.

## Language support (43)

**Full extraction** (functions, classes, methods, imports, exports):
Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, C, C++, Ruby, C#, Swift, Kotlin, Bash, PHP, Dart, Scala, Lua, Elixir, Zig, Haskell, Groovy, Objective-C, R, Julia, OCaml, MATLAB, Clojure

**Structural extraction** (selectors, keys, blocks):
CSS, SCSS, Markdown, JSON, YAML, TOML, Dockerfile, HCL/Terraform, Protobuf, Svelte, Makefile, HTML, GraphQL, XML

**Database DSLs:** SQL, Prisma

## Data layer awareness

cxpak understands your data layer and uses it to build a richer dependency graph:

- **Schema detection** -- SQL DDL, Prisma, Django, SQLAlchemy, TypeORM, ActiveRecord
- **Migration sequences** -- Rails, Alembic, Flyway, Django, Knex, Prisma, Drizzle
- **Embedded SQL linking** -- inline SQL in application code creates edges to table definitions
- **Column-level lineage** -- impact traced at column granularity: "alter `users.email`" resolves to the specific queries, ORM models, endpoints, and tests that reference that column, and a different column's blast excludes the email-only files
- **Live database introspection** -- connect to a running Postgres or MySQL and index the live schema, then compute drift against the schema the code declares. Pure-Rust rustls drivers (no OpenSSL), **read-only**, and the DSN is **never logged or persisted**. Off by default; enabled with the `data-introspect` build feature
- **Typed edge types** -- Import, ForeignKey, ViewReference, EmbeddedSql, OrmModel, MigrationSequence, ColumnReference, CrossLanguage, and more. Each edge carries a confidence marker; heuristic (inferred) edges are labeled so a regex guess is never mistaken for a structurally proven dependency

## Graph query and export

Query the typed dependency graph directly -- five primitives (`nodes`, `node`, `neighbors`, `path`, `subgraph`), identical across MCP, HTTP, LSP, and CLI. Edges carry a typed `edge_type` and a confidence marker; inferred (heuristic) edges are surfaced as such. `nodes` enumerates every valid id with no arguments -- the way to discover ids (they're repo-relative file paths) before calling the others; `subgraph` reports any seed that isn't a real node in `unknown_seeds` rather than echoing it back as one.

```bash
cxpak graph nodes .
cxpak graph neighbors --id src/index/graph.rs .
cxpak graph path --from src/main.rs --to src/output/mod.rs .
cxpak graph subgraph --seeds src/scanner/mod.rs,src/parser/mod.rs --depth 2 .
```

Export the graph to **Cypher** (Neo4j) or **GraphML** (Gephi, yEd, NetworkX) with the same honest typed edges and per-edge confidence:

```bash
cxpak visual --format cypher .
cxpak visual --format graphml .
```

## Embeddings

Semantic similarity is an **optional** 7th scoring signal, **opt-in** via `.cxpak.json`. Without that config the default 6 deterministic signals are used and **no model is downloaded**. When configured, cxpak uses either local inference with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (~30 MB, downloaded on first use) or a remote provider -- OpenAI, Voyage AI, or Cohere with your own key. On `cxpak serve --mcp` the embedding index is built in the background, off the startup path, so it never delays the MCP handshake; if it fails, cxpak falls back to the 6 deterministic signals.

Minimal local config:

```json
{ "embeddings": { "provider": "local" } }
```

## WASM plugin loader — a skeleton, not a working SDK

**You cannot extend cxpak with a WASM plugin today.** `PluginLoader::load()` verifies the module's
checksum, compiles it, instantiates it, and then returns `guest function binding not yet
implemented`. The WIT bridge that would make a guest function callable does not exist, so no plugin
code has ever run.

The `plugins` feature is therefore excluded from `default` — a stock `cargo install cxpak` does not
build it, and the plugin management commands are behind the same gate. What is built out is the
loading path: a manifest with SHA-256 verification before compilation, a 10 MiB module cap, a 64 MiB
memory limiter, and a 10 s epoch deadline. Treat none of it as a security boundary until the bridge
lands and the gaps in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md#the-wasm-plugin-loader-does-not-run-plugins) are
closed — [#42](https://github.com/Barnett-Studios/cxpak/issues/42).

## Workspace support

For monorepos: `--workspace packages/api` scopes scanning to a subdirectory while keeping the full repo as the git root.

## Excluding files

Scanning honours `.gitignore` and, on top of it, an optional `.cxpakignore` at the
repository root. It takes the same syntax as `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Generated code
generated/
*.generated.ts

# Large test fixtures
tests/fixtures/large/
```

Use it for files that belong in the repository but not in the context pack —
generated output, vendored trees, fixtures — or to skip a single file that a
grammar parses badly. `.cxpakignore.example` in this repo is a starting point.

## Caching

Parse results cached in `.cxpak/cache/` keyed on file mtime and size. Cache invalidates automatically when tree-sitter grammar versions change. Atomic writes with advisory locking for concurrent process safety. `cxpak clean .` to reset.

## Rust client (non-default `client` feature)

Rust callers can talk to a cxpak MCP server through the official client rather than
hand-rolling an rmcp session. It is **off by default**, so `cargo install cxpak` still builds
an indexer and pulls no rmcp:

```toml
[dependencies]
cxpak = { version = "3.1", features = ["client"] }
```

If you want the client without the 43 bundled grammars, `default-features = false, features =
["client", "daemon"]` builds the library — `daemon` is currently the floor, not `client` alone.

`CxpakClient` is one method, and its return type is the contract:

```rust
use cxpak::client::{CxpakClient, RmcpCxpakClient};
use serde_json::json;

let client = RmcpCxpakClient::new(std::env::current_dir()?);
match client.call("cxpak_context", json!({"op": "overview"})).await {
    Some(bundle) => use_it(bundle),
    // NOT "the server looked and found nothing" — the tool was unavailable, errored,
    // or degraded. Map it to a skipped observation, never to a verdict.
    None => skip(),
}
```

`RmcpCxpakClient` is lazy: no child process is spawned until the first call, spawns are
backed off after repeated failures, and the child's stderr is nulled so a server banner can
never contaminate a caller that must not write to stderr (a hook, for instance).

For your own tests, `RecordedCxpakClient` replays a `name → response` map with no I/O, and
`from_dir` loads a directory of committed `<tool>.json` recordings. A missing directory is an
**error**, not an empty client — a mis-pathed fixture set reporting a clean run over nothing
is the failure this constructor refuses to have.

```rust
use cxpak::client::RecordedCxpakClient;
let client = RecordedCxpakClient::from_dir(std::path::Path::new("recordings/cxpak"))?;
```

The feature adds `rmcp`, and only `rmcp`, to what gets built (`async-trait` is already in the
default tree transitively). CI asserts both directions — that the client compiles and its
tests run, and that `rmcp` stays out of the default dependency tree.

## Stable API

v2.0.0 establishes semver for the MCP API. Tool names, parameters, and response structures are stable across 2.x.

3.0.0 **consolidates the 26 MCP tools into 5 intent-parameterized tools** (`cxpak_context`, `cxpak_graph`, `cxpak_data`, `cxpak_review`, `cxpak_insight`), each selecting a capability via a required `op` argument. This is the one breaking change in 3.0.0 and affects **MCP clients only** -- the CLI, the HTTP `/v1/*` API, and the LSP `cxpak/*` methods are unchanged. The 26 old tool names remain callable as deprecated, undiscoverable aliases for one release. See [`docs/MIGRATION-3.0.md`](docs/MIGRATION-3.0.md).

## Architecture decisions

Every architecturally significant decision is recorded as an ADR in [`docs/adrs/`](docs/adrs/) -- what was chosen, the options considered, and the conditions under which to revisit it. The records span parsing, the typed dependency graph, relevance scoring, token budgeting, the MCP/HTTP/LSP surfaces, and distribution. Records 0001-0162 were reconstructed across v0.1.0 -> v2.2.1; 0163 onward are written at decision time, now through 0199 (v3.1.0). Start with [the index](docs/adrs/INDEX.md).
